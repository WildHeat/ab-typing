  "Bible": "Jeremiah's Complaint\n12 You are always righteous, Lord,\nwhen I bring a case before you.\nYet I would speak with you about your justice:\nWhy does the way of the wicked prosper?\nWhy do all the faithless live at ease?\n2 You have planted them, and they have taken root;\nthey grow and bear fruit.\nYou are always on their lips\nbut far from their hearts.\n3 Yet you know me, Lord;\nyou see me and test my thoughts about you.\nDrag them off like sheep to be butchered!\nSet them apart for the day of slaughter!\n4 How long will the land lie parched\nand the grass in every field be withered?\nBecause those who live in it are wicked,\nthe animals and birds have perished.\nMoreover, the people are saying,\n'He will not see what happens to us.'\nGod's Answer\n5 'If you have raced with men on foot\nand they have worn you out,\nhow can you compete with horses?\nIf you stumble in safe country,\nhow will you manage in the thickets by the Jordan?\n6 Your relatives, members of your own familyâ€”\neven they have betrayed you;\nthey have raised a loud cry against you.\nDo not trust them,\nthough they speak well of you.\n7 'I will forsake my house,\nabandon my inheritance;\nI will give the one I love\ninto the hands of her enemies.\n8 My inheritance has become to me\nlike a lion in the forest.\nShe roars at me;\ntherefore I hate her.\n9 Has not my inheritance become to me\nlike a speckled bird of prey\nthat other birds of prey surround and attack?\nGo and gather all the wild beasts;\nbring them to devour.\n10 Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard\nand trample down my field;\nthey will turn my pleasant field\ninto a desolate wasteland.\n11 It will be made a wasteland,\nparched and desolate before me;\nthe whole land will be laid waste\nbecause there is no one who cares.\n12 Over all the barren heights in the desert\ndestroyers will swarm,\nfor the sword of the Lord will devour\nfrom one end of the land to the other;\nno one will be safe.\n13 They will sow wheat but reap thorns;\nthey will wear themselves out but gain nothing.\nThey will bear the shame of their harvest\nbecause of the Lord's fierce anger.'",
